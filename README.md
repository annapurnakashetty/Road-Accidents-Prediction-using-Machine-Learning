# 🛣️ Road Accident Prediction Using Machine Learning

This project uses machine learning to predict the likelihood and severity of road accidents. It analyzes factors like **vehicle speed** and **road conditions** to determine their impact and identify which is a more significant contributor.

---

### 📊 Dataset

The dataset used is a **CSV file** named `dataset.csv`. It contains historical accident records with parameters such as speed, road damage, and location.

---

### 🚀 Features

-   **Data Preprocessing & Cleaning**: Handles missing values and normalizes data.
-   **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Visualizes accident trends and correlations.
-   **Machine Learning Model Training**: Trains and evaluates a model to predict accidents.
-   **Performance Metrics**: Reports **accuracy** and a **confusion matrix**.
-   **Trend Analysis**: Generates graphs to show accident trends over time.
