\# Road Accident Prediction Using Machine Learning



This project predicts the likelihood and severity of road accidents based on factors such as vehicle speed, road damage, and other conditions.  

The aim is to analyze accident trends and identify whether \*\*speed\*\* or \*\*road conditions\*\* are more significant contributors.



\## 📊 Dataset

\- Contains accident records with parameters like speed, road damage, location, and more.

\- Dataset format: CSV file (`dataset.csv`).

\- If the dataset is large, it can be uploaded to Google Drive or Kaggle and linked here.



\## 🚀 Features

\- Data preprocessing \& cleaning.

\- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) with visualizations.

\- Machine Learning model training \& evaluation.

\- Performance metrics including accuracy and confusion matrix.

\- Graphs showing accident trends over time.
